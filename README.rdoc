== BTCBrite

This app allows you to accept bitcoin/litecoin/dogecoin/whatevercoin for your event.  When payment is received, it generates a single-use 100% off eventbrite coupon based on the transaction id of the payment so whoever paid you can still go register on eventbrite.

You will need to have bitcoind/dogecoind/whateverd running on the server since I assume localhost.
